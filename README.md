# Under-match Prediction: Equal Access to Quality College
This is a [Data Science for Social Good](www.dssg.io) project to identify high school students who are likely to **undermatch**, that is, students who are academically qualified to go to a high quality college but do not. 

## The problem: oh, the colleges you won't go
Consider two students: Anthony and Benjamin. Anthony is poor and black; Benjamin is rich and white. [Previous studies](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202013/2013a_hoxby.pdf) have shown that even if Anthony has the same academic profile, i.e. SAT, grades, as Benjamin, Anthony is likely to attend less selective colleges. This could happened in three ways:

- Anthony does not attend any college
- Anthony attends a two-year college when he qualifies for a four-year college
- Anthony attends a non-selective four-year college when he qualifies for a selective one

## The solution: prediction and targeting
