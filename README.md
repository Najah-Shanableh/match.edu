# Under-match Prediction: Equal Access to Quality College
This is a [Data Science for Social Good](www.dssg.io) project to identify high school students who are likely to **undermatch**, that is, students who are academically qualified to go to a high quality college but do not. 

This repository contains some of the models we used. 

## The problem: oh, the colleges you won't go
Consider two students: Anthony and Benjamin. Anthony is poor and black; Benjamin is rich and white. [Previous studies](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202013/2013a_hoxby.pdf) have shown that even if Anthony has the same academic profile, i.e. SAT, grades, as Benjamin, Anthony is likely to attend less selective colleges. This is known as **undermatch** and could happened in three ways:

- Anthony does not attend college
- Anthony attends a two-year college when he qualifies for a four-year college
- Anthony attends a non-selective four-year college when he qualifies for a selective one

## The solution: prediction and targeting
Our goal is to identify students at risk for under-match, based on their academic, demographic, socio-economic information. We use data on past high school graduates to model the students' college outcome. We can then apply the model on current high school students to predict their risk of under-matching and find the high-risk students whom the high school can provide extra counseling.
