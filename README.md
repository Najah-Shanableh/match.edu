# Under-match Prediction: Equal Access to Quality College
This is a [Data Science for Social Good](www.dssg.io) project to identify high school students who are likely to **undermatch**, that is, students who have high academic potential but poor college outcome.

This repository contains some of the models we used. 

## The problems
Under-match has two facets. 

### Oh, the colleges you will go
Consider two students: Anthony and Benjamin. Anthony is poor and black; Benjamin is rich and white. [Previous studies](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202013/2013a_hoxby.pdf) have shown that even if Anthony has the same academic profile, i.e. SAT, grades, as Benjamin, Anthony is likely to attend less selective colleges.

- Anthony does not attend college
- Anthony attends a two-year college when he qualifies for a four-year college
- Anthony attends a non-selective four-year college when he qualifies for a selective one

### Higher graduation from higher education
This is a closely related problem. Students who go to community colleges are, compared to their academic equivalent peers who go to 4 year colleges, much less likely to graduate or transfer. 

## The solution: prediction and targeting
Our goal is to identify students at risk for under-match, based on their academic, demographic, socio-economic information. We use data on past high school graduates to model the students' college outcome. We can then apply the model on current high school students to predict their risk of under-matching and find the high-risk students whom the high school can provide extra counseling. 

We are working with the Mesa Public School District, the largest public school district in Arizona, to design and evaluate our predictive models. We are also using data from a national nonprofit organization and other school districts in the United States.

## The project
We numerically quantify under-match, process data, and build various models for under-match estimation. 

### Defining the problem
A student who enrolls in a two year college but is academically qualified to attend a four year college represents under-match.
